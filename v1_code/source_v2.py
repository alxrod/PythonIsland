#First a transparent surface is created that is the size of the frame
#The frame will have the spritesheet drawn to it at the right coordinates
#The frame is upscaled so it's not too small
#A larger transparent surface is created
#The frame is drawn to the larger surface
#The larger surface is stored under a unique name

#This large surface that's created has the sprite on it
#It can be drawn to the screen with screen.blit(sprite,(0,0))
#Or however you draw surfaces to the screen in your game

#I upscale the sprites in my game by multiplying their size by four
#But this might be different depending on what spritesheet you have
#and what resolution your window is

#Also if you need to center the sprite better on the transparent
#background you can adjust the value in stage.blit(character,(130,0))
#The 130 is the x position of the sprite on the transparent background

#If you want to see the transparent background when testing
#the sprite to see if it's centered, remove pygame.SRCALPHA from
#stage = Surface((300,150),pygame.SRCAPLHA)
#pygame.SRCAPLHA tells python to make the image transparent
#stage = Surface((300,150)) would create a black background

#So hope this all makes sense, make sure you type out each line of code
#because copying and pasting it won't workï»¿
